# Online Meeting with Voice-Cloned Translation

This repository contains experimental materials and generated media for the study:

**“Same Voice, Different Language”: An Exploration of Voice-Cloned Translation to Support Non-Native Speakers in Online Meetings**

The project investigates whether **voice cloning–based speech translation** can improve user experience, reduce mental workload, and preserve speaker identity in cross-lingual online meetings compared to conventional text-to-speech (TTS) approaches.

## 📄 Paper Overview

Cross-lingual online meetings are increasingly common, yet most real-time translation systems rely on **generic synthetic voices**, which often remove speaker identity and reduce social presence.

This study compares four audio conditions in a controlled meeting scenario:

1. **Original Speech** (human-recorded)
2. **Gender-Neutral TTS**
3. **Gender-Matched TTS**
4. **Voice-Cloned TTS**

A within-subjects user study (N = 45) demonstrates that **voice-cloned translation**:
- Significantly reduces mental workload
- Improves intelligibility and conversation tracking
- Enhances user experience, engagement, and preference
- Preserves speaker identity better than traditional TTS
